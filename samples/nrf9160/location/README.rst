nRF9160: Location
#################

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

The Location sample demonstrates how to retrieve device's position using selected methods, such as GNSS, cellular positioning or WiFi positioning.
This is achieved utilizing :ref:`lib_location`.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: thingy91_nrf9160_ns, nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns

.. include:: /includes/spm.txt

See also the requirements in :ref:`lib_location`.

Overview
********

The Location sample retrieves the location multiple times to illustrate different ways of retrieving devices location.
This is done simply by implementing each individual location request in a separate function within the sample, and those functions are then called in the main().
In addition to :ref:`lib_location`, this sample uses :ref:`lte_lc_readme` to control LTE connection.

Configuration
*************

|config|

Setup*
======

.. note::
   Add information about the initial setup here, for example, that the user must install or enable some library before they can compile this sample, or set up and select a specific backend.
   Most samples do not need this section.

Configuration options*
======================

.. note::
   * You do not need to list all configuration options of the sample, but only the ones that are important for the sample and make sense for the user to know about.
   * The syntax below allows sample configuration options to link to the option descriptions in the same way as the library configuration options link to the corresponding Kconfig descriptions (``:kconfig:`SAMPLE_CONFIG```, which results in :kconfig:`SAMPLE_CONFIG`).
   * For each configuration option, list the symbol name and the string describing it.

Check and configure the following configuration options for the sample:

.. option:: SAMPLE_CONFIG - Sample configuration

   The sample configuration defines ...

.. option:: ANOTHER_CONFIG - Another configuration

   This configuration option specifies ...

Additional configuration*
=========================

.. note::
   * Add this section to describe and link to any library configuration options that might be important to run this sample.
     You can link to options with ``:kconfig:`CONFIG_XXX```.
   * You do not need to list all possible configuration options, but only the ones that are relevant.

Check and configure the following library options that are used by the sample:

* :kconfig:`CONFIG_BT_DEVICE_NAME` - Defines the BluetoothÂ® device name.
* :kconfig:`CONFIG_BT_LBS` - Enables the :ref:`lbs_readme`.

Configuration files*
====================

The sample provides predefined configuration files for typical use cases.
You can find the configuration files in the |sample path| directory.

The following files are available:

* :file:`esp_8266_nrf9160ns.overlay` - DTC overlay for ESP8266 WiFi chip support.
* :file:`overlay-esp-wifi.conf` - Config overlay for ESP8266 WiFi chip support.
* :file:`overlay-pgps.conf` - Config overlay for P-GPS support.

Building and running
********************

.. note::

   Before building the sample, you must configure a location provider and an API key as instructed in :ref:`lib_location`.

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_nrf9160.txt

ESP8266 WiFi support
====================

To build the Location sample with ESP8266 WiFi chip support, use the ``-DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=esp_8266_nrf9160ns.overlay -DOVERLAY_CONFIG="overlay-esp-wifi.conf"`` options.
For example:

``west build -p -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160ns -- -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=esp_8266_nrf9160ns.overlay -DOVERLAY_CONFIG="overlay-esp-wifi.conf"``

See :ref:`cmake_options` for more instructions on how to add this option.

P-GPS support
=============

To build the Location sample with P-GPS support, use the ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG="overlay-pgps.conf"`` options.
For example:

``west build -p -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160ns -- -DOVERLAY_CONFIG="overlay-pgps.conf"``

See :ref:`cmake_options` for more instructions on how to add this option.

Testing
=======

#. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal|
